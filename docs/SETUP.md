# QuestBooks API Setup

## Adding QuestBooks to Your Mod

Before you can start working with QuestBooks, you first need to add it as either a mod dependency or weak reference to your mod.

First, head on over to the [QuestBooks releases tab](https://github.com/bereft-souls/QuestBooks/releases), find the latest release, and download `QuestBooks.dll`.

Next, in your mod's source folder, add a folder titled `lib/`, and place `QuestBooks.dll` into this folder.

In your mod's `build.txt` add either `modReferences = QuestBooks`, or `weakReferences = QuestBooks`. The former will add QuestBooks as a hard dependency, whereas the second will add it as a soft
reference.

Lastly, open your mod's source code project, and add `QuestBooks.dll` as a project reference.

Now you're ready to begin adding your own quest lines!
